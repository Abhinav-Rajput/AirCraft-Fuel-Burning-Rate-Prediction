# AirCraft-Fuel-Burning-Rate-Prediction
To predict the fuel burn rate, I have used the data from the following competition https://www.crowdanalytix.com/contests/predict-fuel-flow-rate-of-airplanes-during-different-phases-of-a-flight . 

The objective of this Project is to predict fuel flow rate of airplanes during different phases of a flight (Taxi, Takeoff, Climb, Cruise, Approach, Rollout). 

Prediction was done  for cruise phase [‘PH’ = 5] of flight data, as it is the most crucial flight phase in terms of fuel savings .The data was given in five folders , each folder contains 200 flight instances (so total flight instances =1000).The data dictionary of the features (=226) given in dataset was not available as the competition has been closed. Hence, I didn’t know the actual meaning of feature names but by the help of domain experts and Internet research, able to understand most of them.
